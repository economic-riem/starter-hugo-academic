My research interests include Household Finance, Corporate Finance and Digital economics.

I currently research micro household financial behavior and corporate economic behavior using a causal inference framework (DID, RD, and other methods) based mainly on high-resolution geographic data and large-scale micro survey data and data of listed companies.
